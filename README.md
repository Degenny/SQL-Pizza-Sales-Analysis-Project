# SQL-Pizza-Sales-Analysis-Project
This project demostrates my ability to clean, transform and analyse a pizza sales dataset using SQL. 
It includes:
Schema creation and table setup
Data cleaning: handling NULLs, formatting dates and times, trimming strings.
Custom SQL function for text cleaning
Business insights: top selling pizzas, peak order hours and customer preferences.
Backup creation and structured queries for reporting.
This project is part of my hands on learning as a Junior Data Analyst and reflect my attention to detail, problem solving skills and ability to work with real world datasets.
